# What's New in Bluejay 0.3.0?

## Install

```
$ bun add https://github.com/apacheli/bluejay
```

## Additions

- We've added [`highlight.js`](https://highlightjs.org/) support for code blocks. [Click here to see some example themes.](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/main/src/styles)
    - Our highlight plugin is ~**3.57**x faster than other highlighting alternatives!
- MDX files now cache to `.bluejay/mdx`.

### BluejayOptions.post()

You can generate arbitrary files using `BluejayOptions.post()`. This function is executed when all of your pages render.

```tsx
import { start } from "bluejay";

start({
    assets: "src/assets",
    dir: Bun.cwd,
    dist: "dist",
    mode: Bun.env.BUILD_MODE as "build" | "serve",
    pages: "src/pages",
    path: "",
    render: (page, pages) => {
        /* ... */
    },
    post: () => {
        return {
            "/my-file.txt": { data: "Hello, World!", type: "text/plain" },
        };
    },
});
```

## What's Next for Bluejay?

I've recently been experimenting with Svelte's compiler. I don't know if Vue has one, but it would be funny to support Vue too.

I also want to build plugins for Bluejay since arbitrary files are possible now. Stay tuned for what's to come! ~~I'm a one-man team at the moment.~~
