# What's New in {title}?

## Install

```
$ bun add https://github.com/apacheli/bluejay
```

## Additions and Bug Fixes

- We added [`remark-gemoji`](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-gemoji) to better align with the GitHub experience.
- Fixed a highlighting sub language implementation error.
- `preact` and `preact-render-to-string` are preloaded which should amount to ~**15**% faster build times.

### WebSocket Watcher

<img src="/bluejay/wswatcher.avif" alt="The WebSocket watcher in action." />

You can now see your changes occur in real time by enabling [Bun's `--hot` mode](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/hot#hot-mode) and adding the following to your document's body:

```jsx
import { BLUEJAY_DEV } from "bluejay";

const myPage = (
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>Hello, World!</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <BLUEJAY_DEV />
        </body>
    </html>
);
```

`<BLUEJAY_DEV />` will be ignored if `Bun.env.BUILD_MODE === "build"`.
