# What's New in Bluejay 0.5.0?

## Install

```
$ bun add https://github.com/apacheli/bluejay
```

## Debug Improvements

Slight improvements have been made to the debug information to include the size of each file.

<img src={`${Bun.env.BLUEJAY_PATH}/images/0.5.0-debug.png`} alt="The debug information." width="433" height="439" />

## `BLUEJAY_MODE` Variable

We removed `options.mode` in favor of using environment variables. Use `BLUEJAY_MODE` instead.

What each mode does:

- `serve` - Serve development files locally.
- `build` - Build to `options.dist` relative to `options.dir`.

## `BLUEJAY_PATH` Variable

Removed `options.path` in favor of `BLUEJAY_PATH`.

[See Bun's documentation for setting environment variables.](https://bun.sh/docs/runtime/env)

## Heading Slugs

We added support for [heading slugs](#heading-slugs), e.g., `# Hello World` becomes `#hello-world`. Click on the headings on this page to see how it works.

## Custom Index and 404 Pages

You can use `options.index` and `options.notFound` to modify Bluejay's serve behavior. This option does nothing if `BLUEJAY_MODE === "build"`.

```js
import { start } from "bluejay";

await start({
    index: "/",
    notFound: "/404",
});
```

## Alerts

**Bluejay 0.5.0** also comes with support for [GitHub's alert syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts).

> [!NOTE]
> Useful information that users should know, even when skimming content.

> [!TIP]
> Helpful advice for doing things better or more easily.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Key information users need to know to achieve their goal.

> [!WARNING]
> Urgent info that needs immediate user attention to avoid problems.

> [!CAUTION]
> Advises about risks or negative outcomes of certain actions.

> This is a regular quote for reference.

You can use the following CSS to stylize the alert boxes:

```css
/** For all alert boxes. */
.alerts-icon {
    height: 1rem;
    width: 1rem;
}

.alerts-text {
    font-weight: bold;
}

/** For each alert box. */
.alert-note {
    fill: blue;
}

.alert-note-text {
    color: blue;
}
```
