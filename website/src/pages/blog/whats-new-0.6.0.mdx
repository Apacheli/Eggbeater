# What's New in Bluejay 0.6.0?

## Install

```
$ bun add https://github.com/apacheli/bluejay
```

## Browser on Start

Bluejay will now open your default browser when starting the development server.

## Preload Changes

`bluejay/preload` has been renamed to `bluejay/mdx`. We plan to support more template languages in the future with this change.

## `BLUEJAY_PORT`

Removed `options.port` in favor of using the `BLUEJAY_PORT` environment variable.

Bluejay defaults to port `1337` if unset.

## Server Optimizations

The development server has been optimized when parsing URLs by ~**14.6**x, but you may experience minor inaccuracies. Common use cases shouldn't be affected, however.

## Other Updates

We're currently working on proper documentation and a guide for Bluejay.

As Bluejay comes closer to stabilization, we also hope to release binaries to [JSR](https://jsr.io/).
